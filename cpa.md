<details>
        <summary><b>Survey Widget</b></summary>
        <i>This is a module on the RMS dashboard that aids in gathering clientâ€™s financial intentions.</i>

  - <b>My Contributions:</b>
      -  Proposed and engineered the solution with an RDS Aurora, Lambda and an S3 bucket.
      -  Trained engineers on connecting to an AWS database using SSH since this is the first database RMS owned.

    - Business Outcomes:
      - Provided an increased quality of lead, closed loan volume and improve our retention Rate. Business estimated this will result in 225 Million in closed loan volume per yearly and the quality of the leads generated close at 78% or better.

<details>
        <summary><b>Cache Utility</b></summary>
    <i>RMS calls Viper API, that has a shared database for every single read & write for payment information. With the steady increase in volume, Viper Database is becoming overloaded, and in sudden bursts of volume we started to experience issues and time outs. We stabilized payments by adding caching, migrating parts of the loan data collection to Servicing Data Mart API (SDM), and optimizing the SDM calls. Fixing this in RMS API, also helped reduce the calls to all of our downstream legacy systems.</i>

  - <b>My Contributions:</b>
      - Contributed to Quget package owned by Midware to fix a cache availability bug.
      - Made respective changes to Quget packages and services owned by RMS.

## Project 2 - Rocket Mortgage Servicing Web

<br/>

<details>
    <summary><b>Proxy Modernization</b></summary>
<i>The existing node proxy that is in RMS was never intended to be a long lived solution. It was assumed/theorized that the proxy was not even needed. Thus no attention was ever really given to the structure or ease of use. Time has proven to us that the proxy is needed and in its current statement is untenable. It is convoluted and not engineered for growth or development teams or support. In order for RMS to move into the future, the proxy must be reimagined.</i>

  - <b>My Contributions:</b>
    -  Collaborated with Train SRE to re-write the proxy to reduce the complexity of integrating with multiple back-end services.

## Technical Achievements

<br/>

**```Sev-1 Auth0 cert issue```**

[Blameless Incident Report](https://git.rockfin.com/RockCentral-Post-Incident-Process/Blameless-Incident-Reports/blob/8de5c8f23b16015dcd6da8ae32a8038235246d08/36852_201864_-_PROD_-_Rocket_Mortgage_Servicing_API_Multiple_Applications_Having_C_09302021.md)

[PagerDuty Incident](https://rockcentraldetroit.pagerduty.com/incidents/P0EF57N)

The root certificate authority expired and caused a widespread outage across Rocket Mortgage Technology. This took down Rocket Mortgage Servicing and impacted client experience. All the other backend services except Loan Client Settings Service(LCSS) and Client Data Service(CDS) were behind ping and these two were the only two services utilizing auth0 for authentication. When we built these systems and integrated them with our UI, we put them behind a feature flag in Split.IO. By turning these flags off, we were able to bring the site back up for clients with all the functionality except for the settings page. This was a huge win considering the Tech Incident(TI) went on for almost about two days.

<br/>

**```Cache Availability Fix```**

During the pandemic, we were seeing increased traffic to RMS. This was causing issues to some of our legacy downstream applications. I was approached by my team leader to look into Caching some of the response so we reduce the calls to these systems. We were using a quget package to write to redis cache. I found a bug in the package that caused failed writes to the cache when it's unavailable and reached out to the team that owned the package and contributed to the bug fix. I collaborated with my Senior engineer to make the changes in the services we owned to properly log the writes to the cache. This helped us reduce the down time for our downstream legacy systems during high traffic.

<br/>

**```COVID-19: Forbearance Auto-Extension```** 

A few months into the pandemic, Client relations was overloaded with calls from clients regarding forbearance. Our partner, Default Loan Services(DLS) reached out to RMS to build some products to automate the forbearance check-in for clients. RMS went all in. We were provided with business requirements and i led the conversations between multiple teams both on RMS, DLS and the database team to design a robust solution. Even after we went live with the solution, i kept workign with DLS and a couple of database engineers from servicing to fix the data issues by creating sql scripts.


<br/>

**```Loan Client Settings Service and Rocket Credit```**

After the proxy modernization, my team was approached by our Train Architect to build a new service as a part of the decouple from origination. Rocket Mortgage Origination aka Midware owns all the data Rocket Mortgage Servicing clients for settings. We had to decouple and unblock them from moving to cloud. I reached out to my Architect requesting to assist in architect the solution and lead the project. As a part of this, i had the opportunity to work with multiple teams on the train and was able to successfully deliver the project.
